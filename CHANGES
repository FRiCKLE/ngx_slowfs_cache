2013-03-07    VERSION 1.10
    * Fix compatibility with nginx-1.1.12+.
      Due to the changes in cache index usage accounting (1 per request
      instead of 1 per access) initial cache insert of "small" file was
      decreasing usage count, rendering index entry invalid.
      Because cache manager ignores invalid entries, expired cache files
      were not being removed from the cache, which forced it to outgrow
      specified "max_size" value.

2012-04-24    VERSION 1.9
    * Fix issue in which "copy once" fail-safe would be removed
      if (misbehaving) client would disconnect before cache update
      of an expired file was completed.

2012-02-28    VERSION 1.8
    * Fix setting of slowfs process title.
      In case when local path was over 277 characters long, slowfs
      process would crash, which would result in file not being
      copied to the cache.
      Bug had appeared in version 1.7.

2012-02-28    VERSION 1.7
    * Fix on-disk cache size calculation.
      Since the initial release, recorded on-disk cache size was
      decreased twice for purged content (once during cache purge
      and once during subsequent cache update).
      This resulted in recorded on-disk cache size being much
      smaller than in reality, which could lead to on-disk cache
      outgrowing defined "max_size" parameter.
      Patch from Pyry Hakulinen (via ngx_cache_purge, months ago).

    * Append path of the file being cached to the slowfs process
      title.

2011-05-03    VERSION 1.6
    * Fix compatibility with nginx-1.0.1.
      Reported by Sergey A. Osokin.

    * Fix build for nginx-0.8.38+.

2010-01-18    VERSION 1.3

      building module without this.
      Reported by Serhan Sevim.
